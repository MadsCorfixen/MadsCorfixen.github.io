Welcome to this GitHub Pages site, on which the interactive visualisations for my exam in Data Visualisation are
located. Each question described in the Problem Statement of the report pertains to several visualisations, sorted as
seen below. Simply click a link, and the associated visualisation will open in your browser. To view the source code
for the visualisations, either click the 'View on GitHub' icon in the top right corner, or click
