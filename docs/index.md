## Data Visualisation Exam Paper
Welcome to this GitHub Pages site, on which the interactive visualisations for my exam in Data Visualisation are located.
Each question described in the Problem Statement of the report pertains to several graphs, sorted as seen below. Simply
click a link, and the associated visualisation will open in your browser.
 
Which mono-typing and dual-typing of Pokémon is the most common?

[Histogram](https://madscorfixen.github.io/UsedPlots/TypeHistogram.html)
